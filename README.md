📌 Project Overview
As a final project for the Internet of Things and Electrical Engineering course at Calvin Institute of Technology, our group of three developed a concept paper for an IoT-based Campus Building Management System (C-BMS). This system is designed to optimize energy efficiency across campus facilities by using smart sensors, real-time data, centralized dashboards, and AI-powered insights. The proposal uses our own campus as a real-world case study.

- Automate HVAC and lighting systems to improve efficiency by 15–25%
- Enable real-time monitoring with minimal latency and 99.9% system uptime
- Provide actionable AI recommendations to further optimize usage

⚙️ System Architecture
Key Technologies
- IoT Sensors: PZEM-004T (energy monitoring), DHT22 (temperature/humidity), PIR motion sensors
- Communication: LoRa modules (SX1278) & ESP8266 microcontrollers
- Gateway: Dragino LoRa Gateway for wide-area campus coverage
- Backend: Cloud server with secure data storage and real-time analytics
- Frontend: Web & mobile dashboards for energy data visualization and control

🗂️ Project Components
📈 Energy Monitoring: Measure and analyze energy use in classrooms, labs, dorms
❄️ HVAC Automation: Auto-adjust cooling/heating based on occupancy and weather
💡 Smart Lighting: Control lighting based on presence and natural light levels
🤖 AI Predictions: Forecast energy usage trends and provide recommendations
🎨 User Experience: Intuitive UI/UX design with clear floor layouts and real-time graphs
🏗️ Industrial Design: Custom modular hardware enclosures for sensors and nodes

🚀 Future Development
The project roadmap includes:
- Integrating renewable energy sources (e.g., solar panels)
- Enhancing AI models for predictive maintenance
- Expanding to air quality monitoring
- Adding multi-campus scalability

📌 How to Use
Note: This is currently a concept paper with prototype hardware modules.
In the future, the system will be accessible via:
- Sensors & Microcontrollers: Installed across campus buildings
- LoRa Gateway: Collects data to the cloud
- Backend Server: Stores and processes data securely
- Dashboard: Allows managers to monitor usage, receive alerts, and adjust settings
