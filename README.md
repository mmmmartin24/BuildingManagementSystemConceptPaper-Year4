As a final project for this class, I worked in a group of three to develop a concept paper for an IoT-based Building Management System (BMS) designed specifically for campus environments, using my own campus as a case study. In this project, I contributed significantly by planning the electronics and tools to be used, designing the system architecture and connections, defining system functions and potential AI applications, and outlining detailed tasks, timelines, and budgets. I was also responsible for creating the requirement and block diagrams, as well as designing the user interface (UI), service design, and industrial design aspects of the project.
